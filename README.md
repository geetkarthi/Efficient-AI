This repository consists of the 4 parts of Project part 1
The first question is to find the information gain values for each column in a given dataset - this has been implemented using the Math and Counter libraries - and the results have been reported.
The second question is to draw the decision tree for the dataset from the first question, using information gain - this has been implemented using pandas, math and counter libraries. The decision tree was drawn with a seperate tool.
The third question has 2 parts:
Part a is to create a wrapper method to identify the feature importance in the Iris dataset, and iteratively drop features to create a better model. This has been done, along with reporting which feature was dropped and the corresponding accuracy.
Part b is to create a neural network model - which can classify the Iris dataset - and to report the training and testing accuracies and graphs. The graphs have been included in the code, which was done with the scikit-learn library.
